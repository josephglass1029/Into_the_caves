# Into_the_caves

Part 1: Town Business
You spend a few days in town, letting your wounds heal. Since you found so much treasure on your first adventure, you go shopping for some better armor.
Armorer Baldwick knows you well.
He's a jolly fellow, getting a bit gray. You remember snitching apples from the big tree in his yard when you were young and foolish.
"Well, well!" he booms, as you enter his shop. "How have YOU been these days? All grown up now, I see!"
You chat for a few minutes about your younger days, and then you ask if he has any armor that would fit you.
"Why, surely! Let me see, let me see . . ." He pushes his way through racks of armor of all kinds, as you follow closely behind. There are dozens of sets of armor, for people of all sizes, but most of them need repair.
"AHA!" he exclaims, pulling an armload of metal down. "Try this on!"
The armor you are wearing is made of round chain links, all skillfully interwoven to form a covering for most of your body. But this armor is different.
Large pieces of well-crafted metal are fastened to chain mail and leather, fashioned into pieces that you could wear.
"Plate mail, of course; just finished it a week or two ago. Want to try it on? I think it'll fit."
You go to a back room and remove your chain mail, and try this heavier armor on for size. Sure enough, it fits, almost as if it were made just for you.
The metal plates hang from leather straps and chain mail links, forming a tough protective suit. But it's very heavy, almost twice as heavy as your chain mail.
You come out to show him, and he walks around you, carrying a piece of charcoal and marking the armor here and there for some necessary adjustments.
"Looks good!" he exclaims. "Just a bit here, and a bit there . . . want to trade in that chain mail you had on? Looked to be in pretty good shape . . . ."
"Wait a minute!" you reply. "Don't you have anything lighter than this stuff? I'm not going to be able to carry as much treasure if I wear all this metal!"
"Ah, well!" he says, soothingly. "If you want better protection, you have to use this. Unless, of course, you can somehow find magical armor."
Plate mail will improve your Armor Class to AC 2, better than your current AC 4, so it would be nice to have.
"Well, how much?" you ask.
"Well . . . 75 gold pieces as is. Want to trade in that chain mail?" he repeats.
"Oh, I guess so," you reply. "How much?"
"For you, well . . . since you're trying to get started, and since I've known you so long . . . 50 gold pieces, with your trade-in."
You talk with him a bit more, using your Charisma, and bargain him down to a better price.
"Okay, OKAY!" he says finally. "Just 30 gold pieces with the trade-in, and you promise to come here first the next time you need better armor or more weapons. Agreed!" He stomps off, grumbling, then stops and turns. "You can pick it up Tuesday. Pay the clerk on your way out!"
Subtract 30 gold pieces worth of coins from the Money on your character sheet. You can either subtract it from your gp, or use some coins of lesser value if you understand the Conversion Table. Change the numbers on your sheet to account for your spending, and change your Equipment List. Then turn the sheet over, and change your Armor Class to 2.
You come back to the shop in a few days and pick up your heavy Plate Mail (it's not ready on Tuesday, but you have time to wait). You spend the time looking around for other adventurers — any help would be welcome — but the few you find all just want to relax, have a good time, and heal up from their last adventures.
So, fully equipped but still alone, you set off one morning for the caves near town, remembering to watch out for ghouls.

Part 2: Battles
You are almost ready to enter the "dungeon." But first, you need to learn a little more about battles.
You already know how to swing at a monster:
You roll 1d20 (a twenty-sided die), and compare the result to the Hit roll given in the description. If you rolled that number or higher, you hit the enemy, and roll Damage.

More Damage!
In your first adventure, each time you hit a monster you did 1 point of damage. However, from now on, you will roll 1d6 (a six-sided die) to see how much damage you do to the creature you are fighting.
You will keep track of the damage in the same way, writing down the starting number and subtracting the damage each time you hit. Just cross off the old number of hit points, and write down the new number.

The Monsters
Monsters will also be able to do more damage. In your one-player games, you will keep track of their damage on a separate sheet of paper along with your own. In group games, the Dungeon Master keeps track of all the monster details.
Some monsters do 1-6 points of damage, just as you do. But sometimes they do more or less than 1d6. Each time you encounter a monster, the information you need will be given in a box, like this:
GOBLIN: 17
You: 12
D: Id6
hp: 4
The number after the monster's name is the roll it needs to hit your fighter. "D" is the dice to roll after the monster hits, to find the amount of damage it did to you. The monster's hit points are also given.
In this example, if you roll a 12 or higher, you hit the goblin. You then roll 1d6, the standard amount, and add 2 (for your Strength bonus). You subtract that total from the goblin's 4 hp (as given above). If the goblin's new total is zero or less, the creature is dead. If the goblin still has any hit points left, it swings at you:
If you roll a 17 or higher for the goblin's attack, he hits you, for 1-6 points of damage as noted in the box above. You roll the six-sided die and subtract the result from your 8 hit points.

Combat Checklist
A step-by-step list of everything you need to do when fighting a monster is given on the same page as the monster description (the boxed information). Use this checklist for every battle, to be sure you are running each one correctly.

Record Keeping
Use a piece of scrap paper to keep track of the battles. Whenever you find some treasure, write down the amount and type on the same paper. Experience points will be given at the end of the adventure, but you will need a list of the creatures your fighter conquers. All the points for treasure and experience will be added up at the end of the adventure.

Getting Killed
If your character is slain by the monsters, that is the end of the adventure. But it's not the end of the game! You can start the fighter over again, pretending that it is a new character.
If you play this adventure a second time, do not keep any treasure found before you "got killed!" You should start the character over again, from the beginning.
Remember that you are carrying a magical Potion of Healing. If you get hurt, you can drink it, and it will cure all your damage. You can then change your hit points back to 8. You can only drink it once, and then it's gone.
You may drink the potion whenever you wish, but you should wait until you have only 2 or 3 hit points left, if possible. If you drink it in the middle of a battle, you must skip your attack (you are drinking, not swinging), and roll only for the monster's attack for that round of combat.

THINGS TO REMEMBER
1. Keep a record of the monsters killed and treasure found, using a separate piece of paper.
2. Use the Combat Checklist whenever you have a battle.
3. Roll 1d6 each time you hit, to find the amount of damage done.
4. Drink your potion when you are badly hurt.

Mapping
This time, you will make a map of the dungeon so you don't get lost. Maps also help in remembering where the worst monsters were — like the ghouls — so you can avoid them until you feel ready for them.
You will draw your map on a piece of graph paper. Each line one square long will equal 10 feet in the dungeon. Copy each map carefully. Draw an arrow pointing to the top of the paper and label it "North", then draw a line across the arrow and label "East, South, and West." This will help you remember the directions.
As you draw your maps be sure to write notes on it to help you remind you where things are.
If you don't make a map as you go, you will probably get confused.

Part 3: Into The Caves

Since you explored some of the caves earlier, you find yet another entrance to venture into this time. After finding a suitable cave, you pause to be sure you are ready.
The caves are dark and dreary, as you remember from the last time, so you get out your lantern and light the wick, using your tinderbox. Then, carefully, you step into the first "room."
Tear the sheet of graph paper out of the center of this booklet. Then, starting near the bottom, copy Entry 1 Map: 

After the adventure . . .
A map of the entire dungeon is given here. Check your map against it to see if you made any mistakes.
If you had problems with any part of the dungeon, go back and read the difficult section again. Now that you have learned the basics of the game, you will probably see what went wrong.
