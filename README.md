# Into_the_caves

This project is a digital recreation of the 1983 Basic Dungeons & Dragons (Red Box) rules solo adventure by the same name: Into the caves.

I was trying to learn programming, specifically Python and I needed a practical example to experiment with to further my Python knowledge. 
After dabbling with a few different project ideas, I accidentally discovered that a D&D adventure was the perfect scenario to expand my knowledge
and practice all the different techniques that Python has to offer.

The project is being developed in stages as I gain more knowledge I applied more complex techniques.

As of this writing, the program is only text based, running in a terminal window. Eventually, I plan to convert the whole project to a Djano web application.
