The room you are in is fifty feet square, with 10' wide exits in the middle of the north, south, east, and west walls. 
The ceiling of the room is 15' up, but the corridors are only 10' tall. The walls, floor, and ceiling are made of rough
rock. There are some cracks and crevices in the rock walls, all very small. Standing in the exact center of the room is
a stone statue of a woman in armor. You examine it carefully, and finally even touch it â€” but it is merely a statue, nothing
magical or special. You have entered this 50' square room by the southern corridor, which leads out to fresh air and sunlight.
The other corridors are dark. The light from your lamp helps, but shadows linger in the corners of this large room.
Do you want to:
1. Stop and listen?
2. Search the room?
3. Go down a corridor?
4. View my character sheet""")

2. Go shopping for supplies.
3. Quit the adventure; your fighter goes back to town.""")

You go south, and leave the caves. You may go home, and end this adventure, or 
you can go back to the first room. Press any key to continue...""")
